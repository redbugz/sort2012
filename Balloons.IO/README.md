## Installation

The installation of certain tools can be a bit annoying, but these then
become inseparable friends to all developer. We will not explain how
to install each and every one of these tools, especially because their
sites do much better than what we could do ourselves:

### Requirements

-   [node.JS](http://nodejs.org)
-		[Redis-server](http://redis.io)


### Install Redis

    wget http://redis.googlecode.com/files/redis-2.4.17.tar.gz
    tar xvf redis-2.4.17.tar.gz
    cd redis-2.4.17
    make && make install

Start Redis

`./redis-server ./redis.conf`


### Install Balloons.IO

If you have these 2 tools installed, go to terminal and type:

    git clone https://github.com/gravityonmars/Balloons.IO.git
    cd Balloons.IO
    npm install
    mv config/sample.json config/development.json

Then, edit development.json with your favorite text editor and add Facebook & Twitter keys.

To allow Sign In with Twitter: [Create a new application](https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new) and copy 
the keys that Twitter gives you into 'config.json'.

To allow Sign In with Facebook: [Create a new application](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and copy the keys Facebook gives you into 'config.json'

Go to terminal and run `node balloons`.

Point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:6789` (You can also change the port from 'config.json')

Balloons uses [PassportJS](http://passportjs.org) for authentication with Twitter and Facebook.

Enjoy!
